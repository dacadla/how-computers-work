# How computers work
Welcome to my project, "How Computers Work." I'm Radovan Mihalik, and my mission is to make technology accessible and understandable for everyone, especially young learners. This website is dedicated to explaining the fascinating world of computers in simple terms, designed to help students in the MYP 1/2/3 age group (around 12 to 14 years old) grasp the basics.
Through interactive lessons, informative articles, and engaging quizzes, I aim to demystify computer hardware and software, helping students build a solid foundation for their digital journey.

# How to Run
You can run with the integrated PHP dev server if you have it installed. Run this command in the downloaded directory:
```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
```

If you don't have it installed, you can install it with the following methods:
- Windows: With windows I recommend [Scoop](https://scoop.sh), it's easy to install and uninstall, doesn't clutter up your PATH, and it is easy to use. after installing scoop you can install php with `scoop install php`. While it's downloading, you can download the source code you need by going to Code>Download ZIP on this site. Then extract it, and then in the open command prompt after scoop does it's thing, run `cd` with the directory of the extracted folder. You can find the directory on the top bar in the explorer.
- MacOS: On MacOS I recommend [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). After installing Homebrew, install PHP with `brew install php`.
- Linux: On Linux I recommend using your distros package manager (`apt`, `dnf`, `zypper`, `pacman`, etc). If you use linux then you probably know which package to install.
